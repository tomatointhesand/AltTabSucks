"""
D-Bus bridge for the AltTabSucks server — lets the KWin script (which has no XMLHttpRequest, no
process spawning, and no file reads in its scripting sandbox — see the porting checklist's "KDE/
KWin Specifics" section) reach the bridge server's tab state, and spawn processes on its behalf,
via `callDBus`, the one thing that sandbox *does* expose. This is the chosen alternative over
splitting hotkeys across two registration mechanisms: everything stays reachable from inside the
one KWin script.

Requires dbus-python + PyGObject (`python-dbus` and `python-gobject` on Arch) for the D-Bus
object + GLib mainloop. Both were already present on this KDE Plasma install (pulled in
transitively by Plasma itself) — alttabsucks_server.py still checks explicitly at startup and
fails with a clear message rather than a bare ImportError, since that won't hold on every distro.

No token/auth check here (unlike the HTTP API): the D-Bus session bus is already scoped to
processes running as this user's session, which is a stronger boundary than the HTTP token — that
token exists specifically because a malicious webpage can make cross-origin HTTP requests to
localhost with no way for us to stop the request from being *sent* (only from reading the
response). Browsers have no D-Bus access at all, so that attack surface doesn't apply here.

Runs its own GLib mainloop on a dedicated daemon thread, alongside the HTTP server's
serve_forever() loop in the main thread, sharing the same AppState instance directly (no HTTP
round-trip). See the concurrency note above QueueSwitchTab/QueueSwitchOpenUrl below for why this
doesn't need a lock despite the two loops touching the same dicts from different threads.
