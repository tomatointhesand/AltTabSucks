AltTabSucks bridge server — Linux port of Server/AltTabSucksServer.ps1.

The HTTP side (this file) is stdlib only. Originally single-threaded (reasoned in Phase 1 as "one
browser extension polling every 50ms, no concurrency to gain") — that assumption turned out wrong
in production: a real, persistently-running deployment under actual extension traffic showed
sustained concurrent connections (several at once, some plausibly stalled — see the porting
checklist's Phase 1 notes) that a single-threaded server serialized behind whichever connection it
was currently stuck on, wedging every other client including a real browser tab. Now
ThreadingHTTPServer — see AppState.lock for the one place that genuinely needs a lock now that
requests can run concurrently (everything else here is single dict-key get/set, already atomic
under the GIL regardless of threading). Endpoint set, auth model, CORS policy, and body-size caps
are meant to match the PS1 exactly; see CLAUDE.md's "AltTabSucks Server" section for the endpoint
contract consumed by lib/chromium.ahk / lib/firefox.ahk today and by BrowserExtension/background.js
on Linux.

main() additionally starts dbus_bridge (see that module) on its own thread, so the KWin script
can reach the same state via `callDBus` — its scripting sandbox has no XMLHttpRequest. That part
needs dbus-python + PyGObject (system packages, not pip; see _start_dbus_bridge for the install
message). Constructing AppState/make_handler directly (as the tests do) never touches D-Bus.

State lives in an AppState instance rather than module globals, and the handler class is built
per-instance by make_handler(state) — this is what lets tests/test_server.py spin up isolated
server instances (own token, own store) instead of sharing process-wide state, and is also what
dbus_bridge.Bridge shares directly rather than looping back through HTTP.
