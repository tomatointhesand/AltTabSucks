# AltTabSucks — Linux (KDE Plasma)

The Linux port of AltTabSucks, built for **KDE Plasma 6 on Wayland**. Same core idea as the
Windows version — keyboard-driven app window cycling/toggling and profile-aware, URL-based
browser tab focus — reimplemented on top of KWin's scripting API and a small Python bridge
server instead of AutoHotkey.

**Currently supported:** Chromium-family browsers only (Brave, Chrome, Edge, Vivaldi, Chromium —
tested against Brave). Firefox is not ported to Linux yet (see **Known limitations** below).

**Not this file:** for the Windows install, see the [root README](../README.md). For the
day-by-day engineering log of how this port was built — every bug found, every design decision,
and why — see [`alttabsucks_linux_porting_checklist.md`](../alttabsucks_linux_porting_checklist.md).

## Prerequisites

- **KDE Plasma 6** — this relies on `kpackagetool6`/`qdbus6`/`kwriteconfig6` specifically (Qt6
  tools), not Plasma 5's `kpackagetool5`/`qdbus`/`kwriteconfig5`. Wayland is assumed throughout;
  it hasn't been tested under X11.
- **Python 3**, plus the `dbus` and `gi` (PyGObject) modules, and **`gtk4-layer-shell`** (the
  on-screen toast confirmation after a hotkey fires — required, not optional, so you always get
  feedback that a hotkey actually did something). On Arch:
  ```bash
  sudo pacman -S python-dbus python-gobject gtk4-layer-shell
  ```
  (the `kpackagetool6`/`qdbus6`/`kwriteconfig6` trio and `systemctl` all come with a normal KDE
  Plasma install already.)
- **git**, to clone this repo. Clone it wherever you like — `installer.sh` bakes the actual
  clone path into the systemd units it installs, no fixed location required.

`./installer.sh install` checks all of the above up front and refuses to start if any are
missing (with exactly what to install), rather than partway through leaving you with, say, a
working server but silently no toast daemon.

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and run the installer

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomatointhesand/AltTabSucks ~/git/alttabsucks
cd ~/git/alttabsucks
./installer.sh install
```

No `sudo`/UAC needed anywhere — `systemd --user` and `kpackagetool6` are both ordinary per-user
operations, unlike Windows' Task Scheduler + elevation dance.

This walks you through an interactive **browser picker** (autodetects Brave/Chrome/Edge/
Vivaldi/Chromium user-data directories, and — if that browser happens to be open right now —
double-checks its real window `resourceClass` against a live window rather than trusting a
guessed table), then:

1. Installs and starts the bridge server as a `systemd --user` service (`alttabsucks-server`),
   listening on `localhost:9876` — same port as Windows.
2. Installs and enables the KWin script that owns your global hotkeys.
3. Installs the toast daemon.
4. Prints an **auth token** at the end — copy it (also saved to `Server/token.txt` for later).

### 2. Load the browser extension

Same extension as Windows, loaded the same way:

1. Go to your browser's extensions page (e.g. `brave://extensions`)
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. **Load unpacked** → select the `BrowserExtension/` folder in this clone

Open the extension's **Options** page and set:
- **Auth token** — paste the token the installer printed
- **Profile name** — pick from the dropdown (Linux self-discovers your browser's profiles each
  time the server starts — unlike Windows, there's no `P1`/`P2` variable to set by hand anywhere;
  a profile added after the server's already running needs a restart, `./installer.sh stop &&
  ./installer.sh start`, to show up)

### 3. Add your hotkeys

`hotkeys.js`/`hotkeys.json` are gitignored, same as `lib/app-hotkeys.ahk` on Windows — but unlike
that AHK file, their templates (`hotkeys.template.js`/`hotkeys.template.json`) are an
**unsanitized** mirror of them, refreshed automatically on every commit (see `hooks/pre-commit`).
For the meantime, that means a real, working example — this repo's own actual hotkey config as
of the last commit, not generic placeholders — is what `installer.sh` seeds a missing
`hotkeys.js`/`hotkeys.json` from (each independently, whichever one is actually missing) on
install/reload-hotkeys, without `hotkeys.js`/`hotkeys.json` themselves ever being tracked (so a
`git pull` never touches your own local edits to them). Since a `git pull` only updates the
tracked templates, not your gitignored copies, the two can drift out of sync with each other —
e.g. `hotkeys.js` seeded from an older template than `hotkeys.json` was, or one of the pair
hand-refreshed from its template without the other — so if the Hotkeys UI stops matching what's
actually deployed, or a pulled template gained new bindings you want, refresh both by hand from
their templates and run `./installer.sh reload-hotkeys`:
```bash
cp linux/kwin/alttabsucks/contents/code/hotkeys.template.js linux/kwin/alttabsucks/contents/code/hotkeys.js
cp linux/kwin/alttabsucks/contents/code/hotkeys.template.json linux/kwin/alttabsucks/contents/code/hotkeys.json
./installer.sh reload-hotkeys
```
Two ways to edit them:

**The Hotkeys UI (recommended)** — with the server running, open
**`http://localhost:9876/hotkeys-ui`**, paste your auth token, and edit bindings there. Saving
regenerates `hotkeys.js` and redeploys the KWin script automatically — no terminal step needed.
Bindings are grouped by type (app window cycling/toggling, browser profile cycling, tab focus,
split/merge, run-command), and the `resourceClass` field offers a live typeahead sourced from
whatever's actually running right now — the easiest way to find an app's `resourceClass` is
just to launch it once and start typing its name into that field.

**By hand** — edit `hotkeys.js` directly (see its own comments, and `hotkeys.template.js` for
every binding type with inline docs), then run `./installer.sh reload-hotkeys` to deploy.

Either way, the default **`Ctrl+Alt+Shift+'`** reloads hotkeys without a terminal at all (the
Linux equivalent of `AltTabSucks.ahk`'s built-in `^!+'::Reload`) — it's an ordinary
`runCommand` binding pointed at `installer.sh reload-hotkeys`, editable/removable like any other.
If your keyboard can't sense Shift+apostrophe held together (a real hardware limitation on some
keyboards' key matrices, not a bug — shows up as the hotkey silently never firing), rebind it to
something without Shift, e.g. `Ctrl+Alt+'`.

## Managing the service

```bash
./installer.sh status           # server + toast daemon + KWin script load state, plus the auth token
./installer.sh start            # start the server (and toast daemon, if installed)
./installer.sh stop             # stop them via systemd
./installer.sh configure        # re-run just the browser picker (e.g. after switching browsers)
./installer.sh reload-hotkeys   # rebuild + redeploy the KWin script from hotkeys.js
./installer.sh uninstall        # remove the service, toast daemon, and KWin script — also kills
                                 # any orphaned alttabsucks_server.py still holding port 9876,
                                 # which plain `stop` does not
```

You can also inspect the service directly:

```bash
systemctl --user status alttabsucks-server.service
journalctl --user -u alttabsucks-server.service -f   # live server logs
```

`uninstall` deliberately leaves `linux/server/config.py` and `Server/token.txt` in place (same
as the Windows uninstaller leaving `token.txt`) — remove them by hand for a clean slate.

To switch which browser AltTabSucks manages, run `./installer.sh configure`, then
`./installer.sh install` to redeploy the server with the new config.

## Known limitations

Ported so far: app window cycling/toggling (with auto-launch if nothing's open), browser profile
cycling, URL-pattern tab focus, split/merge browser windows, the Hotkeys UI, and toast
confirmations. Not yet:

- **Firefox** — Windows' `lib/firefox.ahk` equivalents aren't ported. Only Chromium-family
  browsers work on Linux right now.
- **Window switcher** (`lib/window-switcher*.ahk`'s typeahead Alt+Tab replacement) — not started.
- **Secrets manager** (`lib/secrets.ahk`/gopass integration) — deliberately not ported as-is;
  revisiting with a different approach later.
- **Settings GUI** — no equivalent of `lib/settings.ahk`'s settings window; everything's
  configured via `config.py`/`hotkeys.js`/the Hotkeys UI page directly.

See the [porting checklist](../alttabsucks_linux_porting_checklist.md) for the full, current
status of every feature area.

## Troubleshooting

**A hotkey does nothing**

Almost always a `resourceClass` mismatch — the single most common failure mode, and it fails
*silently* (no error anywhere, the hotkey just never matches a window). KDE apps in particular
often use reversed-domain names (`org.kde.dolphin`, `org.kde.kate`) rather than their binary
name. Open the Hotkeys UI, launch the target app, and check what the `resourceClass` typeahead
actually suggests for it — don't guess.

**Cycling/toggling an already-open app works, but launching a closed one never does — for every
app, not just one**

The server started before your session finished importing `DISPLAY`/`WAYLAND_DISPLAY` into
`systemctl --user`'s environment — a timing race on login/boot, not a config problem, and once a
process is already running it never picks up an environment update after the fact. Every GUI app
it then spawns fails to connect to any display and crashes instantly and silently on the
server's side; `journalctl --user -u alttabsucks-server.service -e` shows the actual crash
(`could not connect to display`, or similar). Fix for right now:
```bash
systemctl --user restart alttabsucks-server.service
```
This shouldn't recur going forward — an `After=graphical-session.target` line alone was tried
first and turned out **not** to be enough (confirmed live on a real reboot: the server still
started with no display env despite that line already being there). `After=` only orders two
units *within the same startup transaction* — with `[Install]` still pointing at `default.target`
at the time, the server got pulled in and started by `default.target`'s own transaction at login,
completely independently of whenever Plasma later got around to activating
`graphical-session.target` itself. Both `alttabsucks-server.service` and
`alttabsucks-toast.service` now have `[Install]` pointing at `graphical-session.target` instead
(the documented `systemd.special(7)` pattern for a user service that needs the display session),
which makes them actually get pulled in and started as part of *that* target's own transaction —
so `After=` has something real to order against. Re-run `./installer.sh install` to pick up this
change if you installed before it landed (it cleans up the old `default.target` registration
automatically). If it still comes up somehow after that, that's worth reporting.

**Changed a hotkey's key, but the old key still fires (or the new one does nothing)**

`kglobalaccel` locks a shortcut's key to whatever it was on its *first-ever* registration under
that binding's title — by design, so a later script update can't clobber a customization you
made yourself in System Settings. Both saving from the Hotkeys UI and `./installer.sh
reload-hotkeys` already work around this on every single deploy (unregistering every
AltTabSucks-owned shortcut, by its `"AltTabSucks: "` friendly-name prefix, before re-registering
from scratch) — so this shouldn't come up at all through normal use. If it somehow does anyway,
`./installer.sh reload-hotkeys` is the fix.

**Extension shows "server offline"**

- `./installer.sh status` — confirm the server's actually running
- Confirm the extension Options page has the right profile name

**Extension shows a 403 / auth error**

Token mismatch. Get the real one and re-paste it into extension Options:
```bash
cat ~/git/alttabsucks/Server/token.txt
```

**Port 9876 already in use**

Plain `stop` only stops the systemd unit, so an orphaned process from before it was managed by
systemd (or a crash that left one behind) can still be holding the port:

```bash
pkill -f "python3 .*alttabsucks_server\.py"
./installer.sh start
```

**KWin script doesn't seem to be loaded**

```bash
./installer.sh status   # check the "loaded:" line
./installer.sh reload-hotkeys
```

**No toast appears after a hotkey fires**

`gtk4-layer-shell` is a required dependency (`./installer.sh install` refuses to run at all
without it), so if you got this far it should be installed and running. Check
`systemctl --user status alttabsucks-toast.service` — every hotkey's underlying action (window
focus, tab switch, ...) still works even if the toast daemon itself is somehow down, so this is
worth a look but isn't blocking anything else.
